# Team Profile Generator

I was tasked with creating a team profile generator which takes in user input and generates an html page that can be used as a company/business's employee team profile page. The prompts ask the user for the manager's info first, then the user can enter as many engineer and intern team members till they decide to finish and generate the team page. The employees are setup as class objects with the Employee object being the parent class and the Manager, Engineer and Intern objects inherit the name, id and email methods. A manager has a unique office number, an engineer has a unique github username and an intern has a unique school in their constructors with get methods for each. The page is generated by looping through an array that is filled with these employee objects during the prompt process and the information is filled into a string with the html template using the get functions to fill the specific data. Then the html string is written as a file to dist and the style.css file is copied to dist. The program can be run using the command node index.js and all the tests can be activated using npm run test. The prompts are using the inquirer node module and the unit testing is through the jest node module.
